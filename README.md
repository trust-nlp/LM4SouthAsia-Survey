# LM4SouthAsia-Survey
A collection of papers and resources of language models (LLMs) for Low-Resourced Languages in South Asia

Despite the rise of large language models (LLMs), South Asian languages still struggle with limited resources, code-mixing, and diversity, making it necessary to develop inclusive resources for these languages. This repository brings together models, adaptation strategies, and resources on bias and evaluation to help bridge the gap. 

We aim to record and provide a structured overview of existing resources to promote future research work for improving NLP technologies in South Asia.  

## 1. Models
